<h2>Instructions</h2>
<body>
    <p>Gather the Following Ingredients:<br>
        <ul>flank steak, canned tomato sauce, white or yellow onion, bell pepper, carrots, salt and pepper, garlic salt, oil </ul>
    </p>
    <p> In a sauce pan sautee diced carrots, onion strips, and bell pepper to get an aromatic base going. <br>
        Season to taste and next add in your flank steak, do not cook all the way! The point is to cook the steak with the vegetables about halfway, next add a thin layer of water to the mix and immediately your canned tomato sauce. <br>
        The tomato sauce water should cook your meal for the second half with the lid on. Make sure the sauce is thick enough that it can absorb the water from the cooking ingredients without becoming translucent, but not too thick that it will dry out.<br>
        Let it come to a boil and then lower the heat, you'll know it's ready when you can use your fork to split through a carrot with ease. <br>
        Optional: Make a simple white rice or lime juice salad to add. <br>
        Now, you've got yourself a simplified version of a Salvadorean staple. Just <i>something like home</i> that can make your day &#x1F604 </p>
