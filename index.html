            <p>Total cook time should be about 20 minutes. <br>Gather the Following Ingredients: flank steak,
                canned tomato sauce, 
                white or yellow onion,
                bell pepper,
                carrots,
                salt and pepper,
                garlic salt, 
                and oil. </p>

            <p>
            In a saucepan, saut√© diced carrots, onion strips, and bell pepper to get an aromatic base going. Add a teeny bit of water to help the veggies steam and soften up.
            <span class="highlight">Next, add in your flank steak seasoned to taste--but do not cook all the way!</span> The point is to let the steak cook with the vegetables about halfway by sauteing, then switching methods and finishing it off by letting it come to a boil. 
            For this part, you will add a cup of water followed by canned tomato sauce. <span class="highlight">Also, it is important to keep the lid on for the second half.</span> Make sure the sauce is thick enough that it can absorb the water from the cooking ingredients without becoming translucent, but not too thick that it will dry out.
            Let it come to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. <span class="highlight">You'll know it's ready when you can use your fork to split through a carrot with ease.</span>
            Optional: Make a simple white rice or lime juice salad to add.

            <p>Now, you've got yourself a simplified version of a Salvadoran staple. Just <i>something like home</i> that can make your day &#x1F604</p>
